# Adapster
A local fork of the [Adapster](https://github.com/arthur3486/adapster) library.

The `Adapster` comes as public API of this library. However, the `Adapster` is available only on the
`jcenter` repository, which has been deprecated quite a while ago. To avoid users of this library
having to declare `jcenter` as a repository source, the `Adapster` lib has been copied over (its public
API is pretty small) to fix this exact problem.
